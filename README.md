❓**Why Not Use Mobile SMS Data?**

### This project does not scrape SMS messages for a few key reasons:

 - 💵 Cash transactions don’t generate SMS → data would be incomplete
 - 📝 SMS rarely includes categories or notes, which are crucial for deep analysis
 - ⚠️ SMS parsing differs across banks → error-prone and inconsistent
 - 🔒 Accessing SMS requires privacy-intrusive permissions
 - ✅ Manual entry ensures clean, context-rich data for AI insights

🧠 **AI Insights**

### Our AI storytelling feature provides:

 - 📈 Key expense trends
 - 💡 Saving opportunities
 - ⚠️ Overspending warnings
 - 🎯 Expense concentration highlights
 - 🧩 Contextual suggestions based on your notes

### The goal: explain your financial health in human terms, not just numbers.

📁 **Sample Data**

 - sample_data/expense_dummy_data.xlsx provided for testing.
 - Includes realistic dummy transactions (2024 → Sept 2025).
 - Format: DD-MM-YYYY, with categories, debit/credit details, and notes.

🔐 **Security Notes**

 - Never commit your personal birthday.json or auth.json.
